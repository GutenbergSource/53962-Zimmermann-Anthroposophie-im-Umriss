<HTML><BODY>From Wikipedia: Robert von Zimmermann or Robert Zimmermann (November 2, 1824, Prague – September 1, 1898, Prague) was a Czech-born Austrian philosopher.

<p>In this book, which appeared in 1882, the author gives an overview of his philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Note that this book predates the founding of the Anthroposophical Society by Rudolph Steiner with more than 30 years, and, although most likely, Steiner borrowed the name of his movement from this work, and some of the ideas, but you will find nothing of the latter's occultism in this work.

<p>The book is German, but except for the dedication, it is printed in a normal font, and will pose no problems.

<p>For the opening and close quotes, please use the common quotation mark (") instead of the low double comma. Please do not use guillemets (Gänsefüßchen), except if they actually appear in the work.

<p>Please do not modernize the spelling. Keep old spellings as they are in the original!
